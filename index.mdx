## Get started in 30 seconds

Prerequisites:

- An **Atlas account** (contact Arya Hezarkhini from Arena in **#sp-arena-ghost** to get set up)

### **Install Atlas CLI:**

To install Atlas CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```shellscript
curl -fsSL http://ghost.anduril.gov.arena-ai.com/api/v1/cli/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, activate it in your current terminal:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="zshrc">
    ```shellscript
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="bash">
    ```shellscript
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, link your Atlas account to the CLI

### **Authenticate**

```shellscript
atlas login
```

This prompts you to open the login page and generates an authenticat token. Once you finish logging in, enter the authentication token and navigate back to your terminal.

## Upload flight data

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single flight">
    ```shellscript
    atlas upload flight.bin --tailnum 4308
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Single flight with logs">
    ```shellscript
    atlas upload flight.bin -l heliod.log can.log --tailnum 4308
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multiple flights">
    ```shellscript
    atlas upload flight1.bin flight2.bin flight3.bin --tailnum 4308
    ```

    All flights process simultaneously
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The `--tailnum` is required to identify the asset when uploading flight logs

### What happens next

1. Your files are uploaded and a Ghost Flight Report job starts
2. Processing takes 5-10 minutes depending on file size and log analysis
3. When complete, you get a link to your report and the page for that asset
